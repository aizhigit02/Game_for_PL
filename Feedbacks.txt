I believe that the game made by Nursultan and Aizhigit is the result of hard work and I am pretty sure that a lot of effort was spent on its development. Their work looks great! It works well, and no difficulties came across while using it. Moreover, games design and color harmony is amazing. Everything is lucid and I am sure that it will be really interesting for its users. In brief, the idea is excellent, and I am in love with their creation. Good luck!
